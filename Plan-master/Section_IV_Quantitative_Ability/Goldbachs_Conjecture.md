# Goldbach's conjecture

Goldbach's conjecture is one of the oldest and best-known unsolved problems in number theory and all of mathematics. It states:

**Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes**

The conjecture has been shown to hold for all integers less than 4 Ã— 10^18 ,but remains unproven despite considerable effort.
